Practice project that I made to learn how to manipulate the DOM. Game randomizes six colored squares and gives you an RGB color code. If the square you select matches the color code you win! Teaches user the RBG color system.

This project helped me learn the basics of DOM manipulation as well as programming principles like functional and modualr programming.
